# Building-Decision-Tree-from-scratch
This repository presents a comparison of scikit-learn decision tree with manually written code from scratch for the same by implementing both the classifiers on a particular data set. The analytically interpretation was carried out by plotting different graphs based on different parameters common to both the classifiers and later both their statistics were compared using different statistical tests.
